## 🚀 Project Overview

Starting from a solid React foundation, this portfolio has evolved into a polished, professional showcase featuring advanced design, smooth animations, and responsive functionality tailored for all devices.

## 🎨 Visual Design & User Experience

- **Custom Color Palette & Theming:**  
  Professionally crafted light and deep dark modes with distinct backgrounds, vibrant primary/accent colors, and strong contrast for readability.

- **Refined Typography:**  
  Utilizes Google Fonts — *Poppins* and *Roboto Mono* — to enhance readability and aesthetic appeal.

- **Shadows, Borders & Background Effects:**  
  Custom shadows (`shadow-custom-light`, `shadow-3d-dark`) and animated linear gradient backgrounds add depth and modernity.

- **Custom Scrollbar & Text Selection:**  
  Branded scrollbar styling and selection highlights ensure cohesive branding throughout.

---

## ✨ Dynamic Animations & Interactivity

- **AOS (Animate On Scroll) Integration:**  
  Smooth, varied animations (fade-up, zoom-in, fade-right/left) across all sections create engaging content reveal effects.

- **Hero Section Enhancements:**  
  - Continuous glowing animation on the name  
  - Breathing/pulsing animation on the profile photo with animated border  
  - Animated blurry “blob” background effects

- **Interactive Cards:**  
  Portfolio projects and service cards feature 3D tilt effects using `react-parallax-tilt`.

- **Micro-Interactions:**  
  Buttons, links, and calls-to-action have smooth transitions and hover feedback.

## 📱 Enhanced Functionality & Mobile Responsiveness

  Dynamic background and shadow on scroll for a polished user experience.
